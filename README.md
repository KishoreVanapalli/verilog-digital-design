# Verilog HDL – Digital Design

This repository showcases my structured self-training in **Verilog HDL** through practical digital design and verification projects.

It represents **7+ days of disciplined RTL development**, covering combinational logic, sequential logic, FSMs, and communication protocols.

The focus is on:
* Clean RTL coding
* Strong testbenches
* Functional verification
* Modular design
* Recruiter-readable structure

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **01_combinational** → Logic gates, adders, mux, ALU
* **02_sequential** → Flip-flops, counters, shift registers
* **03_fsm** → Moore/Mealy FSMs, traffic controller
* **04_communication** → UART TX, RX, baud generator
* **05_mini_projects** → Integrated system-level designs

**Each folder contains:**

* Verilog RTL files
* Testbench files
* VCD waveform outputs
* Folder-level README.md explaining the designs
