# Sequential Logic Modules

This folder contains clock-driven digital circuits that store and update state based on clock edges.

## Modules Included
- D Flip-Flop
- JK Flip-Flop
- Shift Registers (left, right, rotate)
- Counters (up counter, down counter, mod-10 counter)
- Registers

## Concepts Covered
- Edge-triggered storage elements
- Clock and reset handling
- Blocking vs non-blocking assignments
- State retention
- Synchronous design principles

## Verification
Each module includes:
- Clock generation inside testbench
- Reset testing
- Functional state transition checking
- VCD waveform generation for timing observation

## Tools Used
- Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave

## Purpose
This folder demonstrates my understanding of:
✔ Sequential logic design  
✔ Flip-flop based storage  
✔ Clocked behavior  
✔ Timing awareness  
✔ Proper testbench methodology  

These designs are essential for building processors, controllers, and communication systems.
