# Digital Communication Modules

This folder focuses on serial data transmission and reception using UART-based communication.

## Modules Included
- UART Transmitter
- UART Receiver
- Baud Rate Generator
- Serial Communication Testbench

## Features Implemented
- Start bit, data bits, stop bit framing
- Baud rate clock generation
- Bit sampling and reconstruction
- Parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel conversion

## Concepts Covered
- Asynchronous serial communication
- Clock division
- Bit timing control
- Data synchronization
- Protocol modeling

## Verification
Testbench includes:
- Simulated serial data stream
- Receiver reconstruction verification
- Timing validation using waveforms

## Tools Used
- Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave

## Purpose
This folder demonstrates my understanding of:
✔ UART protocol  
✔ Serial communication fundamentals  
✔ Timing-sensitive digital design  
✔ Real-world protocol modeling  

UART is a widely used protocol in embedded systems and SoC designs.
