# Finite State Machine (FSM) Designs

This folder contains control-oriented digital designs modeled using Finite State Machines.

## FSM Types Implemented
- Moore FSM
- Mealy FSM
- Traffic Light Controller (3-way)
- Sequence detectors

## Concepts Covered
- State encoding
- State transition logic
- Output logic design
- Moore vs Mealy comparison
- Reset and default state handling

## Design Methodology
Each FSM is implemented using:
- State register
- Next-state logic
- Output logic
- Parameterized state definitions

## Verification
Testbenches include:
- Controlled input sequences
- State transitions observed through waveforms
- Output correctness validation

## Tools Used
- Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave

## Purpose
This folder demonstrates my understanding of:
✔ Control logic design  
✔ FSM architecture  
✔ Behavioral modeling  
✔ Complex state handling  
✔ Real-world controller logic  

FSMs are widely used in traffic control, protocols, and digital controllers.
